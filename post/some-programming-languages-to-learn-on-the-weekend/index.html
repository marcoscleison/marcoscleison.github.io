<p>Learning a new languages is a hobbie for me. That&#039;s why I am to happy on sharing 6 interesting lesser known interesting programming language.
The first three languages, Terra, Io and Neck shares some features. The principal is its easiness on integration/embedding  with/in others existent systems. This kind of languages are used usually to alloy bigger and complex system be customized and extended by a fancier language.</p>

<p>The last two languages are languages that compile to native but bringing the best of scripting language, like Ruby, lisp, python etc.</p>

<p>That is the list of interesting programming language to learn on the weekend.</p>

<h1 id="terra">Terra</h1>

<p>C languages uses macro preprocessor to allow some control over the code logic. C++ uses the powerful template definitions to allow metaprogramming. However, C++ templates can be complex and inflexible to some voluble metaprogramming form. This issue is is resolved in the Terra language.</p>

<p>Terra means &quot;earth&quot; in Portuguese language. This name comes from its counterpart and auxiliary language Lua (which means moon in Portuguese).</p>

<p>Terra is a fast low level language that uses the lua language as template and macro generator for impressive metaprogramming.
This languages uses a lua like syntax and is perfectly compatible with luavm .</p>

<p>Similarly to C++, terra does not have garbage collector, its memory is  manually managed. However, terra uses lua as template language from the beginning.</p>

<p>The language have core operators, function calls, types and control-flow surrounded by lua language. This feature makes terra a language with powerful metaprogramming.
Lets see an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lua">
terra addone(a : int)
    return a + 1
end

print(addone(2)) --this outputs: 3

</code></pre>

<p>This example shows a terra function called &quot;addone&quot; that receives en integer parameter and add one to its value returning it. The value is sent to the output.</p>

<p>To differentiate terra function from lua functions, the language prefixes its function declaration with &quot;terra&quot; keyword.</p>

<p>The language allows to call native function using the lua function &quot;terralib.includec&quot;.</p>

<pre><code class="language-lua">local C = terralib.includec(&amp;quot;stdio.h&amp;quot;)
terra main()
    C.printf(&amp;quot;hello, world\n&amp;quot;)
end

main()

</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the stdio.h C functions are imported and scoped to the loacl lua contruct (local C). The terra function uses the well known function printf to display the message.</p>

<p>This code can be executed using the Terra jit. The terra jit is built upon the LLVM compiler construction framework. However, jit is not the only model of terra execution. The language also allows to compile the code to object file .o and also as an executable. The compilation parameters is defined in the source code using lua language.</p>

<pre><code class="language-lua">- save a .o file you can link to normal C code:
terralib.saveobj(&amp;quot;hello.o&amp;quot;,{ main = main })

-- save a native executable
terralib.saveobj(&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;, { main = main }) 
</code></pre>

<p>The terra language can be easily embedded in third party applications. Its provides an API similar to Lua language:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;quot;terra.h&amp;quot;

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    lua_State * L = luaL_newstate(); //create a plain lua state
    luaL_openlibs(L);                //initialize its libraries
    //initialize the terra state in lua
    terra_init(L);
    for(int i = 1; i &amp;lt; argc; i++)
        //run the terra code in each file
        if(terra_dofile(L,argv[i]))  
            exit(1);
    return 0;
}
```,

# Io

Io is a dynamic and expressive prograaming language. It is heavily based on Smalltalk, Self, NewtonScript, Act1,Lisp and Lua.

From Smalltalk, Io language brings the &amp;quot;all values are objects&amp;quot;. The Self language contributes to Io with the prototype-based inheritance. Act1 was used as inspiration to bring actors and futures for concurrency.   
Io also have modifiable AST and runtime inspection based on Lisp. The interpreter API can be easily used because its design have a similar simplicity of Lua embedding  API. 

Io language remarkably does not have statement. It possess only expressions that are evaluated along code execution. This feature make Io a language with small syntax  as we can see in its BNF grammar:
```bnf
exp        ::= { message | terminator }
message    ::= symbol [arguments]
arguments  ::= &amp;quot;(&amp;quot; [exp [ { &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; exp } ]] &amp;quot;)&amp;quot;
symbol     ::= identifier | number | string
terminator ::= &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot; | &amp;quot;;&amp;quot;

</code></pre>

<p>The expressions is delimited by new line carriage return or &quot;;&quot;. The expression is composed main by an identifier representing an object, string or numeric value followed by a message and optional arguments in the form:</p>

<pre><code>object message (args)
</code></pre>

<p>The message is a key concept in smalltalk based language. It is related to the method idea existent in C++, and Java.
The execution of &quot;method&quot; code is started when the &quot;object&quot; receives the message. The messages can have none or more parameters that is sent to the object through message slot.
So, in a hello world program in Io should be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">&amp;quot;Hello, world!\n&amp;quot; print
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot; string object (remeber:every value is an object, even numbers) receives the message &#039;print&#039; that exhibits  content of string.</p>

<p>The Io language have basic assignment arithmetic, conditional and logical operators with infix. Ex.:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">a := 10

c := a +3

c print

</code></pre>

<p>The code above is parsed as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a   object is created and its receives an assignment message with 10 as parameter. The assignment message sets the value of object.</p></li>

<li><p>c object is created and receives assignment message containing as parameter the value evaluated from &quot;a + 3&quot;. The expression &quot;a + 3&quot; is executed as a object receives the sum operation message with 3 as parameter. The execution of this operation is sent to c.</p></li>

<li><p>c object, now with value 13, receives a message from print slot informing to display its value.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is kind a mantra, that all values are object that can receive messages. Even control-flow are not statement but functions that have condition and code block as parameters. The if expression can be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">(a == 1) ifTrue (
  writeln(&amp;quot;a is one&amp;quot;)
) ifFalse(
  writeln(&amp;quot;a is not one&amp;quot;)
)
</code></pre>

<p>(a = = 1) is a function that returns a Boolean valued object. This kind of object have the &quot;ifTrue&quot; message and the &quot;ifFalse&quot; message. If the value returned by (a ==1 ) is true, the &quot;ifTrue&quot; message is executed evaluating its parameters expressions (code block). if the value returned is false, the &quot;ifTrue&quot; message is ignored, but the &quot;else&quot; message is sent, evaluating the expression.</p>

<p>The &quot;for&quot; function is used to repeat expressions evaluations. Ex.:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">for(i, 1, 10, write(i, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;))

</code></pre>

<p>The for function receives four parameters: the counter, the initial value of range, the final value of range and the expressions to be repeatedly evaluated according to the range values. the code above will print the i value from 1 to 10.</p>

<p>The repetition control while have a similar syntax. The function while receives two parameters: the loop condition and the expression to be executed. Ex.:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">a := 1
while(a &amp;lt; 10, 
    a print
    a = a + 1
)
</code></pre>

<p>In this example the function while evaluates two expressions while a value is less than 10.</p>

<p>This syntax is elegant to write object oriented code. An object of type list can be created with syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">//creates an empty list
a := List clone
// append  an item
a append(&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;)

//gets the list size and display it
a size print

</code></pre>

<p>The &quot;Classes&quot; are defined from the Object prototype and customized adding field and methods.</p>

<pre><code class="language-io">//Creates Dog &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; like object
Dog := Object clone
//Creates a field in Dog &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;
Dog name := &amp;quot;Marley&amp;quot;
//Creates the method bark
Dog bark := method(&amp;quot;woof!&amp;quot; print)
//Instanciate a new object from the &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; Dog
bob := Dog clone
//Executes the method bark
bob bark
</code></pre>

<p>The function &quot;method&quot; is used to create method in Io objects. The parameter is a list of expressions that is evaluated when method is called.</p>

<p>There are others interesting features in this language. To know more about go to <a href="http://iolanguage.org/">http://iolanguage.org/</a> .</p>

<h1 id="squirrel">Squirrel</h1>

<p>Squirrel is an interpreted object oriented language in the Java, C++ sense.</p>

<p>The language is inspired by several programming language stars. From Lua language, the Squirrel brigs the small footprint interpreter, allowing to be used in limited resource hardware (low memory, low bandwidth etc.) making it suitable to real-time applications such as games app.</p>

<p>Squirrel also is inspired by others languages like JavaScript and Python.</p>

<p>The language is suitable to be used in open source and commercial projects because it is licensed as MIT licence.</p>

<p>Its scripting nature brings dynamic typing similar to javascript with additional features such as delegations higher order functions, lexical scoping,generators, efficient tail recursion etc.
The language also possesses    classes and inheritance with a Java like syntax. This reduces the learning curve to new comers.</p>

<p>Squirrel has an hybrid memory management system structured by the combination of garbage and reference counting approach.</p>

<p>The compiler and the virtual machine is tiny sized source. They have less than 7 LOC in C++. This results in an executable with size 100kb-150kb.</p>

<p>Lets see en example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-squirel">local table = {
	a = &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;
	subtable = {
		array = [1,2,3]
	},
	[10 + 123] = &amp;quot;expression index&amp;quot;
}
 
local array=[ 1, 2, 3, { a = 10, b = &amp;quot;string&amp;quot; } ];
 
foreach (i,val in array)
{
	::print(&amp;quot;the type of val is&amp;quot;+typeof val);
}
 
/////////////////////////////////////////////
 
class Entity
{	
	constructor(etype,entityname)
	{
		name = entityname;
		type = etype;
	}
									
	x = 0;
	y = 0;
	z = 0;
	name = null;
	type = null;
}
 
function Entity::MoveTo(newx,newy,newz)
{
	x = newx;
	y = newy;
	z = newz;
}
 
class Player extends Entity {
	constructor(entityname)
	{
		base.constructor(&amp;quot;Player&amp;quot;,entityname)
	}
	function DoDomething()
	{
		::print(&amp;quot;something&amp;quot;);
	}
	
}
 
local newplayer = Player(&amp;quot;da playar&amp;quot;);
 
newplayer.MoveTo(100,200,300);

<h1 id="necko">Necko</h1>

<p>Necko is a programming language that runs on NeckVM. Its primary aims is to serve as a target language platform for new high level language. In other words, necko language can be used as compiler beckend.</p>

<p>The language possesses a compiler that translate from necko source code to bytecode and a small  virtual machine to execute it.
After installation, you can execute necko bytecodes with command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">necko app
</code></pre>

<p>Each compiled necko file has the extension .n and contains the language modules. The VM can use necko based dynamic libraries. These libraries have extension .ndll by its internal structures are.</p>
